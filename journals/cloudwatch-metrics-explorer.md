# CloudWatch metrics explorer

CloudWatch metrics explorer is a flexible tag-based tool that filters, aggregates, and visualizes metrics by resource tags. With tag-based monitoring, you create a dynamic application infrastructure health dashboard that automatically updates as you deploy new resources, using the resulting visualizations to spot patterns, correlate the results, and reduce the time taken for resolution.
